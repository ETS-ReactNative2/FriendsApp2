# FriendsApp2

## A Demo app on API integrations, redux and map
It consist of three parts:

**Friends:** Implented API from [reqres](reqres.in), which is used in the log in and sign up screen, and it's also used to populate list of users, and display each of their profile when one navigates to the profile page.

**GitHub Jobs:** Created as a sub-application in the friendsApp2, to search for Software Developer's job, and to link to the GitHub Jobs page or their respective website.

**Walker:** Also created as a sub-application, to show the exact location of a user and then choose a destination, and then it shows the user the shortest route to get to the destination, and when the user is close to the destination it shows the image of the area using Google Maps API and Google Places API.

### Technologies involved:
- React-native
- Redux-rematch
- React-native-maps

- Google Maps API
- Google Places API
- Reqres API
- GitHub Jobs API
